			  <h2 class="layout-title">About Me</h2>
				<p class="layout-text">Hi, I'm Jessica Boe! I grew up in a little town in Florida called Palmetto. I moved to Tampa after high school and then ended up in Raleigh, NC a few short years later. I have been married for 15 years to my spectacular husband, Steve. Together we have produced two smart, sassy, and incredibly outgoing children, Anthony and Sophie. We also have two dogs, Max and George, and a cat, Shadow.</p>
				<p>I enjoy eating and traveling with my best friend of over 20 years. I'll try anything once because life is too short to not be adventurous. Someday I'd really like to take a ride in a hot air balloon. I truly believe that laughter is the best medicine. I've had many losses in my life so I try to live in the moment and not take things for granted.
				</p>
				<h2 class="layout-title">Why Graphic Design?</h2>
				
				<p class="layout-text">
				Well, honestly, because I got a brochure in the mail for the local community college and it peaked my interest. They had an Advertising & Graphic Design Associates Degree Program and I thought, "Hmmm, I think I could do that". I love art, crafting, and DIY projects. I made my own wedding invitiations and I love making party flyers. I'm always critiquing magazine and television ads and wondering, "How did this one get approved and what were they thinking?" <p>I had been working as a bankruptcy paralegal for 8 years (right through the middle of the recession) and was completely wiped out from doing that, so I decided I would go back to college at 35 years old! Fast forward two and a half years and I will be graduating on December 14th, 2019!</p>
				</p>
				<p class="layout-text">
				So guess what that means? I'm looking for work!
